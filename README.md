# detect-native-overrides

## Getting Started
```
npm install
```

## Bookmarklet
Build the bookmarklet and copy output into your clipboard with:
```
browserify ./src/bookmarklet.js | pbcopy
```

Take that output and create a bookmarket with a [bookmarklet maker](https://caiorss.github.io/bookmarklet-maker/). 

Explore to a page and click the bookmarklet you just created.

## Expected output
In the console, you will see a `warn` with an array of overriden methods. 

If you see a method name without a namespace, presume `window`.

*Example:*

## Testing
```
npm test
```

## Limitations
This bookmarket won't work on pages with strict CSPs, like twitter.com.

We currently rely on `Object.getOwnPropertyNames` which has decent [browser support](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/getOwnPropertyNames#Browser_compatibility).

[Tampermonkey](https://tampermonkey.net/) is a wonderful tool that I highly encourage everyone to try out. That said, it overrides many natives, so I recommend that you disable it before running the bookmarklet.
